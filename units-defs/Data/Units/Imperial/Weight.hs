-- Due to the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_yard_and_pound
-- International yard and pound agreement of 1959>, it so happens that
-- Imperial and US customary units of weight have the same base (the
-- international pound at 0.45359237 kilograms). However, if subdivisions
-- are generally the same, Imperial units feature different multiples of
-- the pound, due to the presence of the stone. As in, using English
-- conventions, the hundredweight is the *long* one (the short one is the
-- cental). As is the ton.
-- Also, of the troy system (the international one being, more or less,
-- the avoirdupoids one) only the ounce is legal.
--
-- Where possible, reference have been made to UK legislation. However,
-- Wikipedia's page is /much/ better organized than any government
-- resource immediately available.
