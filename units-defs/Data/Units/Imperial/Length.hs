-- Due to the <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_yard_and_pound
-- International yard and pound agreement of 1959>, it so happens that
-- Imperial and US customary units of length have the same base (the
-- international yard at 0.9144 meters). However, if subdivisions are
-- generally the same, Imperial units feature multiples of the yard that
-- US customary ones generally don't (e.g. the Imperial furlong is defined
-- by reference to the international yard, not the US survey one).
--
-- Where possible, reference have been made to UK legislation. However,
-- Wikipedia's page is /much/ better organized than any government
-- resource immediately available.
