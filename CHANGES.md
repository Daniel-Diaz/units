Version 2.1
-----------

* Separated monomorphic and polymorphic interface.

* Includes a decently comprehensive test suite.

Version 2.0
-----------

This is a major update. `units` now supports the notion of a local unit set
and of separable dimensions and units. See the description in the
[draft paper](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~eir/papers/2014/units/units.pdf) for
more info.

This update will very likely break any code that used `units-1.x`.

The update was written in partnership with Takayuki Muranushi.
